Thread Divergence:
	-> Control Divergence: Thread number must be a multiple of the block size so sometimes there might be additional threads that aren't necessary.
	In these cases, the required computation count would be compared with the threadId to make unnecessary threads do nothing.

	The bigger size of the computation, the smaller impact control divergence over the performance.
	Ex: For 100 elements, control divergence will happen for %25 of the existing threads while it will be lesser than %1 for 10000 elements.
! The performance impact of control divergence decreases as the number of data in the horizontal dimension increases.
